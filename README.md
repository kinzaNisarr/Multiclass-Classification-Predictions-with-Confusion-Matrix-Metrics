# Multiclass-Classification-Predictions-with-Confusion-Matrix-Metrics
Analyzing and Interpreting Multiclass Classification Predictions with Confusion Matrix Metrics in Python

Introduction
This project revolves around utilizing and interpreting confusion matrices and related metrics (precision, recall, F1 score) to evaluate multiclass classification predictions in Python. We explore three distinct classes, facilitating an understanding of the model's predictive capabilities, misclassifications, and areas that require improvement.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python: Ensure that Python (preferably version 3.7 or later) is installed.
Libraries: The project utilizes NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn.

Usage
The project contains Python scripts (or Jupyter Notebooks) which showcase:
Constructing confusion matrices from actual and predicted classification labels.
Visualizing the confusion matrix using a heatmap.
Calculating and interpreting precision, recall, and F1 score for each class.
Deriving and interpreting the weighted F1 score for the model.
To execute Jupyter Notebooks, navigate to the project directory and launch Jupyter Notebook:
